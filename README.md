A convenience wrapper for the textlocal.in api requests for transactional as well as promotional accounts. The reseller account specific api are not available at this point in time.

Sms messaging can be used for transactional messages like:
- Sending OTP for Two Factor Authentication
- Confirmation of payment received or order placed etc

Transactional messages need to be sent through at any time without any DND (Do Not Disturb) restrictions. For this one needs to register a Transactional Account with Textlocal or request for conversion of the default account to a Transactional Account.

On the other hand Sms messaging may also be used for promotional activities like:
- Announcing product launch or discount sale
- Announcing an award receid=ved by the company or product
- Sending coupon code etc

Promotional messages need to adhere to the DND (Do Not Disturb) restrictions. The default signup at Textlocal creates a Promotional Account by default.

## Installation

```bash
$ composer require thinkstudeo/textlocal
```

## Config
Package facilitates using Transactional as well as Promotional Account with Textlocal at the same time.

Add the following to your `config/services.php` file
```php
'textlocal' => [
    'transactional' => [
		'apiKey' => env('TEXTLOCAL_TRANSACTIONAL_KEY')
    ],
    'promotional' => [
        'apiKey' => env('TEXTLOCAL_PROMOTIONAL_KEY')
    ]
]
```
Don't forget to add the keys to your `.env` file

If you have just one  - i.e. Promotional Account or Transactional Account - make sure to enter the API key accordingly.
For example, for just a Textlocal Promotional Account, declare `TEXTLOCAL_PROMOTIONAL_KEY=api_key_for_your_promotional_account`.
```
TEXTLOCAL_TRANSACTIONAL_KEY= <your textlocal transactional account api key here>
TEXTLOCAL_PROMOTIONAL_KEY= <your textlocal promotional account api key here>
```

## Usage

There are two facades included with the package:
- `Sms` for sending messages
- `Account` for interacting with the Textlocal Account

For differentiating the api calls with respect to account type use `transactional()` or `promotional()` to set the account for the api call.

### Messaging - Transactional Account
You must have a transactional account with Textlocal inorder to send transactional sms without DND restriction 24x7.
Also don't forget to get your templates for the transactional messages approved by Textlocal.
Finally, you must generate an API KEY from your Textlocal dashboard
![API KEY](/docs/api_key.png)

Then you can use the facade like
### To send to a single user
```php
Sms::transactional()
    ->to('911234523451')
    ->from('SENDER')   //Your registered sender
    ->send('My message');  //as per your approved template
```
### To send to multiple users at once
```php
Sms::transactional()
    ->to('911234523451,919898456456')
    ->from('SENDER')   //Your registered sender
    ->send('My message');  //as per your approved template
```

OR, you can also provide the numbers as an array
```php
Sms::transactional()
    ->to(['911234523451', '919898456456'])
    ->from('SENDER')   //Your registered sender
    ->send('My message');  //as per your approved template
```
And if you want to schedule a message to be sent at a specified time in future
you can provide a datetime string in any of the formats supported by [Carbon](https://carbon.nesbot.com/) 
or you may also provide a unix timestamp.
```php

$schedule = "2019-01-01 09:30:00"; 

Sms::transactional()
    ->to('911234523451,919898456456')
    ->at($schedule) 
    ->from('SENDER')   //Your registered sender
    ->send('My message');  //as per your approved template
```
To cancel a scheduled message
```php
//Get a list of all the scheduled messages
$response = Account::transactional()->scheduledMessages();
$scheduledMessages = $response->scheduled;

//Identify the scheduled message you want to cancel
$msg = $scheduledMessages[0];

//Cancel the message
Account::transactional()->cancel($msg->id);
```
### Messaging - Promotional Account

### To send to a single user
```php
Sms::promotional()
    ->to('911234523451')
    ->from('TXTLCL')   //or Your registered sender
    ->send('My message');  
```
### To send to multiple users at once
```php
Sms::promotional()
    ->to('911234523451,919898456456')
    ->from('TXTLCL')   //or Your registered sender
    ->send('My message');  
```

OR, you can also provide the numbers as an array
```php
Sms::promotional()
    ->to(['911234523451', '919898456456'])
    ->from('TXTLCL')   //or Your registered sender
    ->send('My message');  
```
And if you want to schedule a message to be sent at a specified time in future
you can provide a datetime string in any of the formats supported by [Carbon](https://carbon.nesbot.com/) 
or you may also provide a unix timestamp.

```php
$schedule = "2019-01-01 09:30:00";

Sms::promotional()
    ->to('911234523451,919898456456')
    ->at($schedule) //unix timestamp
    ->from('TXTLCL')   //or Your registered sender
    ->send('My message');  //as per your approved template
```
To cancel a scheduled message
```php
//Get a list of all the scheduled messages
$response = Account::promotional()->scheduledMessages();
$scheduledMessages = $response->scheduled;

//Identify the scheduled message you want to cancel
$msg = $scheduledMessages[0];
